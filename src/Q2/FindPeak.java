 PROBLEM STATEMENT:


 A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than
 a neighbor that is outside the array.
 You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
